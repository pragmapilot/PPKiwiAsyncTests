PPKiwiAsyncTests
================

Small test app to understand Kiwi BDD tests for methods called assynchronously.

Most of the stuff in [KiwiAsyncTests](https://github.com/pragmapilot/PPKiwiAsyncTests/tree/master/KiwiAsyncTests) folder is relevant. It just defines a protypical API class that makes Web Requests and calls methods synchronously and assynchronously on success. 


[KiwiAsyncTestsTests](https://github.com/pragmapilot/PPKiwiAsyncTests/tree/master/KiwiAsyncTestsTests) contains the specs.
